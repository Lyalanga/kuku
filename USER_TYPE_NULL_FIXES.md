# User Type Null and Profile Edit Redirect Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. "Unexpected User Type Null" Problem
**Root Cause**: During login/registration, user type was sometimes not properly set or retrieved as null.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **AuthManager.login()**: Enhanced user type extraction with fallback logic
  - If user type is null/empty from API response, defaults to "vet" for admin users and "farmer" for others
  - Ensures user type is always set during login
  - Added `KEY_PROFILE_COMPLETE = true` for existing users during login

- **AuthManager.signUp()**: Improved user type normalization
  - Ensures user type is always normalized to lowercase and trimmed
  - Prevents null/empty user types during registration

- **AuthManager.getUserTypeSafe()**: Enhanced with better fallback
  - If user type is null/empty, defaults to "farmer" and saves it
  - Always returns a valid user type

- **AuthManager.isSessionValid()**: Enhanced validation
  - Uses `getUserTypeSafe()` instead of `getUserType()` to prevent null issues
  - Validates user type against known valid types using NavigationManager
  - More robust session validation

### 2. Redirect to Login After Profile Edit Problem
**Root Cause**: `onResume()` methods in MainActivity and AdminMainActivity were too aggressive with session validation and would redirect to login if token refresh failed.

**Fixes Applied**:
- **MainActivity.onResume()**: Improved session handling
  - Added user type validation before attempting token refresh
  - Non-farmer users are redirected to correct interface instead of login
  - Token refresh failures don't immediately redirect to login
  - Only redirects to login if session is completely invalid

- **AdminMainActivity.onResume()**: Similar improvements
  - Added user type validation before attempting token refresh
  - Non-vet users are redirected to correct interface instead of login
  - More tolerant of token refresh failures
  - Better session validation

- **FarmerProfileEditActivity**: Added profile completion marking
  - Calls `authManager.markProfileComplete()` after successful profile save
  - Ensures profile completion status is properly maintained
  - Works both for successful saves and offline scenarios

### 3. Enhanced Session Management
**New Methods Added**:
- `AuthManager.markProfileComplete()`: Safely marks profile as complete without affecting other auth data
- Enhanced `isSessionValid()`: More robust validation with user type checking

## Key Improvements

1. **Robust User Type Handling**: User type is always set and validated throughout the app
2. **Better Session Validation**: Sessions are validated more thoroughly but less aggressively
3. **Improved Error Recovery**: App continues to work even if token refresh fails
4. **Profile Completion Tracking**: Proper tracking of profile completion status
5. **Interface Routing**: Users are routed to correct interfaces instead of being logged out

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Login Flow**: Test login with both farmer and vet accounts
2. **Profile Editing**: Edit profile and ensure user stays logged in
3. **Session Recovery**: Test app behavior with expired tokens
4. **User Type Validation**: Ensure no "unexpected user type null" errors
5. **Interface Separation**: Verify farmers see farmer interface, vets see vet interface

- `app/src/main/java/com/example/fowltyphoidmonitor/utils/NavigationManager.java`
- `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - **CRITICAL**: Added missing activity declarations

## Result

The app fixes are applied but testing revealed:
- ‚úÖ **Doctor/Vet login and profile editing**: FIXED - Works perfectly now
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Farmer login and profile editing**: Still experiencing "unexpected user type null" 
- üîß **Root Cause**: Fixed missing AndroidManifest activities, but farmer user type handling needs further investigation during registration/login flow

## Current Status (July 6, 2025)

### ‚úÖ **WORKING PERFECTLY**
- **Doctor/Vet Users**: Can login, access their interface, edit profile without any errors
- **Activity Resolution**: Fixed missing `AdminMainActivity` and `AdminProfileEditActivity` declarations in AndroidManifest.xml
- **User Type Routing**: Vet users properly routed to AdminMainActivity interface

### ‚úÖ **CRITICAL CONSISTENCY FIXES APPLIED**
- **Unified user type keys**: Changed all preferences to use "userType" (camelCase) consistently
- **Standardized user types**: All "admin" references now map to "vet" for consistency  
- **Fixed AuthManager**: Now uses getUserTypeSafe() in loadUserProfile() to prevent null values
- **Fixed key mismatch**: loadUserProfile() now uses "userType" key to match MainActivity expectations
- **Comprehensive protection**: Added user type validation throughout the app

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **READY FOR TESTING** 
- **All inconsistencies fixed**: User type handling is now completely consistent across the app
- **Should resolve "unexpected user type null"**: The key mismatch and null issues have been addressed

## Next Steps for Complete Fix

1. **Clear Supabase Data**: Delete all existing users (as user mentioned)
2. **Test Fresh Registration**: 
   - Register new farmer account
   - Register new doctor account  
   - Test profile editing for both
3. **Monitor Logs**: Watch for any remaining user type null issues during registration/login flow
4. **Additional Debugging**: If issues persist, add more logging to registration and login processes

The app is now much more robust with comprehensive user type protection throughout the profile editing flow.
