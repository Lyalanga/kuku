Summary of User Registration & User-Type Separation Fixes
Background:
The app previously allowed users (farmers, vets/admins/doctors) to be registered in the wrong Supabase table, causing user-type confusion and incorrect access to features.
What Was Done:
User Type Enforcement:
Registration now requires an explicit userType ("farmer" or "vet"). No default or fallback is allowed.
"admin" and "doctor" are internally mapped to "vet" for all logic.
Correct Table Insertion:
After successful Supabase Auth registration, the app extracts the unique user_id from the Auth response.
If userType is "farmer", a Farmer object is created with this user_id and posted to the farmers table.
If userType is "vet", a Vet object is created with this user_id and posted to the vets table, using the required Authorization and API key headers.
No Cross-Insertion:
Each user is inserted into only one table, never both.
No fallback to "farmer" for vet/admin/doctor is possible.
Error Handling:
User-friendly error messages are shown for duplicate emails, missing user_id, or failed profile creation.
All API calls are checked for success and handle errors gracefully.
Code Clean-Up:
Fixed method signatures and imports to match the actual ApiService interface.
Removed unused or incorrect code and clarified logic for future maintainers.
How Data Flows:
Registration → Supabase Auth (get user_id) → Create Farmer/Vet object → Insert into correct table via Retrofit API call.
How to Get User Data:
Use the user_id to fetch the profile from the correct table (farmers or vets) using the appropriate GET endpoint.

Result:
User registration is now robust, with strict user-type separation and correct data flow to Supabase. Each user is guaranteed to be in the right table, with all required fields set.

Next Steps for Developers:
Test registration for both user types.
Confirm that each user appears only in their correct table in Supabase.
Review error logs for any edge cases or failures.
If further issues arise, check the ApiService interface and ensure all required fields and headers are provided for each API call.
